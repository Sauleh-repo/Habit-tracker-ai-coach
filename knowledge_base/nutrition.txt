Macronutrients (The Big Three)

Protein

Function
Required for muscle repair and maintenance.
Supports enzyme production, hormone regulation, immune function, and neurotransmitters.
Most satiating macronutrient.

Recommended Intake
General health: approximately 0.8 g per kg of body weight.
Physically active or muscle-building individuals: 1.6 to 2.2 g per kg.

Common Sources
Meat, fish, eggs, dairy.
Legumes, tofu, tempeh.
Quinoa and other high-protein grains.

Low protein intake is associated with increased fatigue, cravings, muscle loss, and impaired recovery.

Carbohydrates

Function
Primary energy source for the body and brain.
Broken down into glucose and stored as glycogen in muscles and liver.

Types
Simple carbohydrates
Rapid energy and faster blood sugar response.
Examples include fruit, sugar, and refined grains.

Complex carbohydrates
Slower digestion, sustained energy, and higher fiber content.
Examples include oats, brown rice, vegetables, and legumes.

Recommended Intake
Typically 45 to 65 percent of total daily calories.
Intake should scale with activity level.

Chronically very low carbohydrate intake may increase stress hormones and impair sleep in some individuals.

Fats

Function
Essential for hormone production such as testosterone and estrogen.
Required for absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.
Supports brain health and cell membrane integrity.

Types
Saturated fats
Found in meat, butter, and coconut oil.
Limit to less than 10 percent of total calories.

Monounsaturated fats
Found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts.
Associated with cardiovascular benefits.

Polyunsaturated fats
Omega-3 sources include fish and flaxseed.
Omega-6 sources include various plant oils.
Essential for inflammation regulation.

Trans fats
Found in industrial hydrogenated oils.
Highly inflammatory and should be avoided.

Micronutrients

Definition
Vitamins and minerals required in small amounts to support physiological function.

Key Micronutrients

Magnesium
Supports muscle relaxation, nervous system regulation, and sleep quality.
Sources include leafy greens, nuts, and seeds.

Vitamin D
Supports bone health, immune function, and mood regulation.
Sources include sunlight exposure and fortified foods.

Iron
Required for oxygen transport in blood.
Heme iron comes from animal foods, non-heme iron from plant sources.

Zinc
Supports immune function, hormone production, and wound healing.

Micronutrient deficiencies commonly impair energy, mood, immunity, and sleep.

Hydration

Importance
Regulates body temperature.
Lubricates joints.
Transports nutrients.
Even 1 to 2 percent dehydration can impair cognitive and physical performance.

General Guidelines
Drink to thirst as a baseline.
Common reference ranges:
Men approximately 3 to 4 liters per day.
Women approximately 2 to 3 liters per day.
Increase intake with heat exposure, exercise, or high protein intake.

Electrolytes
Includes sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
Essential for nerve signaling and fluid balance.
Especially important after heavy sweating or intense exercise.

Energy Balance

Caloric Surplus
Energy intake exceeds expenditure.
Supports weight gain and muscle growth.

Caloric Deficit
Energy intake below expenditure.
Leads to weight and fat loss.

TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
BMR: Basal metabolic rate.
TEF: Thermic effect of food.
NEAT: Non-exercise activity.
EAT: Exercise activity.

Nutrition as a Core Health Habit

Nutrition strongly influences energy levels, cognitive performance, metabolic health, mood stability, immune function, hormone regulation, and long-term disease risk.

Poor nutrition compounds stress, disrupts sleep, increases inflammation, and degrades decision-making.

Nutrition should be treated as a daily systems habit, not a short-term intervention.

Core Principles of Effective Nutrition

Energy Consistency

The body performs best with regular, adequate energy intake.
Extreme restriction and chaotic eating increase physiological stress.

Guidelines
Eat 2 to 4 structured meals per day.
Avoid long, unplanned fasts unless intentional and well tolerated.
Large caloric deficits increase stress hormones and impair sleep.
Consistency matters more than perfection.

Protein Intake (Foundational)

Guideline
Approximately 1.6 to 2.2 g per kg of goal body weight.
Equivalent to roughly 0.7 to 1.0 g per pound.

Best Practices
Distribute protein evenly across meals.
Aim for approximately 25 to 50 g per meal.
Earlier protein intake improves energy and appetite control.

Carbohydrates as Fuel

Carbohydrates support brain glucose demands, physical performance, thyroid and reproductive hormones, and sleep via serotonin and melatonin pathways.

Guidelines
Match carbohydrate intake to activity level.
Favor whole-food sources.
Avoid unnecessary elimination.

Dietary Fats and Hormonal Health

Guidelines
Include fats in most meals.
Avoid ultra-low-fat diets.

Preferred Sources
Olive oil, nuts, seeds, and avocados.
Fatty fish rich in omega-3s.
Whole-food animal fats in moderation.

Food Quality and Gut Health

Micronutrient Density

Prioritize nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables (especially leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables), fruits like berries and citrus, animal products rich in iron, zinc, and B12, and legumes, nuts, and seeds.

Aim for variety across the week rather than daily perfection.

Fiber Intake

Benefits
Supports blood sugar regulation, gut microbiome health, and appetite control.

Guideline
Approximately 25 to 40 g of fiber per day from whole foods.

Increase fiber gradually to avoid gastrointestinal discomfort.

Meal Timing and Blood Sugar

Regular Meal Timing

Irregular eating disrupts circadian rhythm and glucose regulation.

Guidelines
Eat at consistent times.
Avoid large meals right before bed.
Front-loading calories earlier in the day benefits many individuals.

Blood Sugar Stability

Large glucose swings increase fatigue, irritability, and cravings.

Stabilizing Strategies
Pair carbohydrates with protein and fat.
Avoid liquid sugars.
Eat slowly and mindfully.

Stable blood sugar improves focus and emotional regulation.

Ultra-Processed Foods

Characteristics
High sugar, fat, and salt combinations.
Low micronutrient density.
Engineered for overconsumption.

Guideline
Minimize frequency rather than aiming for absolute elimination.
Build meals around whole foods first.

Chronic reliance on ultra-processed foods increases inflammation and metabolic dysfunction.

Alcohol and Nutrition

Effects
Disrupts glucose regulation.
Impairs sleep and recovery.
Increases appetite dysregulation.
Adds non-nutritive calories.

If Consumed
Keep frequency low.
Avoid late-night intake.
Pair alcohol with food and adequate hydration.

Supplements (Optional)

Supplements cannot replace adequate nutrition.

Common Context-Dependent Options
Protein powder for convenience.
Omega-3 fatty acids.
Vitamin D for low sun exposure.
Magnesium in cases of deficiency or high stress.

Guidelines
Use supplements to fill gaps, not override poor habits.
Add one supplement at a time.
Avoid megadoses.

Individual Variability

There is no universal optimal diet.

Nutrition needs vary based on activity level, stress load, sleep quality, genetics, and gut health.

Track outcomes rather than ideology, including energy, mood, hunger, sleep quality, and digestive comfort.

Adjust intake based on response.

Nutrition and Habit Adherence

Undereating, low protein intake, or erratic meals increase impulsivity, reduce willpower, and amplify stress responses.

Stable nutrition improves focus, emotional regulation, and long-term habit consistency.

System Summary

Nutrition is a keystone daily habit.
Protein sufficiency and regular meals matter most.
Whole foods outperform restriction.
Supplements are secondary, not foundational.
Consistency beats optimization.
Sustainable nutrition comes from repeatable structure, not extremes.
