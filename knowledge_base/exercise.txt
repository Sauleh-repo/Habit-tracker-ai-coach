Physical Activity & Exercise Knowledge Base
––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Core Philosophy & Importance

Exercise as a Keystone Habit
Exercise is a primary regulator of physical health, cognitive function, emotional stability, metabolic efficiency, and sleep quality. It is a non-optional biological input, not merely a performance goal or aesthetic pursuit.

Physical Impact
Improves insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function, bone density, and immune resilience.

Mental Impact
Neurochemistry
Increases dopamine (motivation), serotonin (mood stability), endorphins (pain modulation), and BDNF (learning and neuroplasticity).

Regulation
Reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms independent of fitness changes.

The Golden Rule
Consistency beats intensity. The body adapts to repeated exposure, not sporadic extremes.

Fundamental Training Principles

Progressive Overload
The gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during training. Without this, the body has no stimulus to adapt (get stronger or fitter).

Variables to Adjust
Intensity: Increase weight or resistance
Volume: Increase repetitions or sets
Density: Decrease rest time between sets
Efficiency: Improve technique and form

NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)

Definition
Energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating, or dedicated sports-like exercise.

Examples
Walking to work, fidgeting, cleaning, standing, typing.

Importance
Accounts for a significant portion of daily caloric burn, often exceeding that of a dedicated workout.

Official Guidelines (WHO)

Adults (18–64)

Aerobic
150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity OR 75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week.

Strengthening
Activities involving all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week.

Movement Domains & Protocols

Effective programs include four non-overlapping domains. Neglecting one creates health limitations.

A. Daily Low-Intensity Movement (Baseline)

Goal
Maintain metabolic health and prevent sedentary degradation.

Protocol
Move every day. Break up prolonged sitting every 30–60 minutes.

Metric
Accumulate 6,000–10,000 steps per day or equivalent.

B. Cardiovascular Training (Heart & Lungs)

Two primary intensity zones

Zone 2
Low to moderate intensity. You can hold a conversation comfortably.
Biological benefit: Builds aerobic base, improves mitochondrial efficiency, fat oxidation, and metabolic health.
Protocol: 2–4 hours per week. Walking uphill, cycling, steady jogging. Should be about 80 percent of total cardio.

Zone 5
Vigorous or max effort. Breathing is difficult or talking is impossible.
Biological benefit: Improves maximum stroke volume and VO2 max. Strongly linked to longevity.
Protocol: 1–2 sessions per week. Short duration work such as HIIT, sprints, or hill repeats. Requires recovery.

C. Strength Training (Muscle & Bone)

Goal
Hypertrophy (size), strength (force), and bone density preservation.

Frequency
2–4 sessions per week.

Core Movement Patterns

Squat (knee dominant)

Hinge (hip dominant)

Push (upper body)

Pull (upper body)

Carry (load bearing)

Rotate or stabilize (core)

Repetition Ranges
5–8 reps: Strength emphasis
8–15 reps: Hypertrophy, growth, and joint health

Mechanics
Compound movements
Recruit multiple muscle groups and joints (e.g., deadlift, bench press). High CNS fatigue.

Isolation movements
Target single muscles (e.g., bicep curl). Lower fatigue.

D. Mobility & Joint Health

Goal
Maintain range of motion and tissue quality. Prevent pain.

Protocol
Brief work daily. Longer sessions 1–3 times per week.

Focus Areas
Hips, spine, shoulders, ankles.

Sensation
Should feel restorative, not exhausting.

Recovery & Adaptation

Adaptation occurs during recovery, not during exertion.

Types of Recovery

Active Recovery
Low-intensity movement such as walking or yoga to flush metabolic waste and increase blood flow without added stress.

Passive Recovery
Complete rest.

Overtraining Warning Signs
Persistent fatigue, elevated resting heart rate, irritability, decreased performance, or insomnia.

Deloads
Periodic reduction in volume or intensity every 4–8 weeks to prevent overuse injuries and burnout.

Safety & Longevity

Pain vs. Discomfort

Discomfort
Muscle burning, fatigue, and effort are normal and required for adaptation.

Pain
Sharp, shooting, joint-localized, or worsening pain is a warning signal. Stop immediately.

Injury Prevention

Progressive Exposure
Avoid large jumps in training load.

Form
Perfect control matters more than maximal weight.

Troubleshooting & Habit Formation

The Minimal Effective Dose

Use this when motivation is low or life is busy to prevent habit collapse:

Walk daily

Perform 1–2 short strength sessions per week

Do brief mobility work

Momentum is harder to restart than to maintain.

Timing

Morning
Best for circadian alignment.

Afternoon
Often yields peak physical performance.

Evening
High intensity late at night may disrupt sleep.

Verdict
The best time is the one you can stick to consistently.
